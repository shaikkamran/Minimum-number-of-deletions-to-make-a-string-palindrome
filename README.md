# Minimum-number-of-deletions-to-make-a-string-palindrome
Python program for minimum no of deletions of caharacters in a string to make it a palindrome using dynamic programming.''' 
'''Take every substring's length and put the length of the longest possible palindrome sting  into matrix(of that lenght)
to that corresponding position and the last pos i.e,arr[0][n-1] will be the length  of the largest substring possible which
is palindrome after deletions of characters.
